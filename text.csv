I love and approve of myself.
I am capable 
Today and everyday I choose to be happy
You deserve self care
You are resilient
There is some good in this world and it is worth fighting for 
"Once you choose hope, anything is possible"
Even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise
I am enough
We can be heroes just for one day
"Courage, dear heart"
"After all, tomorrow is another day"
"The ingredients of health and long life are great temperance, open-air, easy labor, and little care"
"That which does not kill us, makes us stronger"
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are"
"To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield"
"We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope"
"I am deliberate and afraid of nothing,"
"Your perspective is unique. It’s important and it counts,"
"Your life is already a miracle of chance waiting for you to shape its destiny,"
Embrace the glorious mess that you are
"The ultimate truth of who you are is not I am this or I am that, but I Am"
Nothing can dim the light that shines from within
The perfect moment is this one
I rebel; therefore I exist 
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep.”"
Not all those who wander are lost 
The secret of getting ahead is getting started
"You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think"
"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but rising everytime we fall"
It's okay to not have everything figured out 
"Your speed doesn’t matter, forward is forward "
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever did 
"After all, life goes on "
Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.
Be as you wish to seem
"You may not end up where you thought you'll be, you'll end up where you need to be "
Make yourself a priority 
It's always darkest before the dawn
one day at a time
"If it's not your time now, it will be soon "
All we have to do is decide what do with the time given to us 
Even miracles take a little time 
"Oh yes, the past can hurt but we can either run from it or learn from it "
Sometimes the right path is not the easiest one 
Forever is composed of nows
What is now in the past was once in the future
The only lies for which we are truly punished are those we tell ourselves
"Wholeness does not perfection, it means "
"Not all storms come to disrupt your life, some come to clear your path"
